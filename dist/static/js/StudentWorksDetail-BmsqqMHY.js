The original problem space focuses on picky-eating be- havior of toddlers. During the research, I identified this as a common issue among young children aged 4-8, which is also one of the most serious issues that troubles parents.

Design Response

I designed and developed PuddingVerse, an interactive dinning, featuring gamified quest and dynamic interac- tion, which aims at improving the dinning behavior of toddlers.
